          <h3>Historical Contexts: Germany and the US</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Exhibit Description</h4>
          German and American women's rights movements had different historical
          contexts, which affected their goals, tactics, and achievements.
          <br /><br />
          Germany saw the women's rights movement emerge during a time of
          political and social upheaval during the late 19th and early 20th
          centuries. Following unification, women began demanding political
          rights and greater economic opportunities. Although
          <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.15217"
            >Germany's unification process after 1871 was heavily dominated by
            men and gave priority to the "Fatherland" theme and related male
            issues,</a
          >
          such as military prowess, women became much better organized
          themselves. Women were active participants in socialist and labor
          movements throughout Germany, with which the women's movement was
          closely associated.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bund_Deutscher_Frauenvereine"
            >Formal organizations for promoting women's rights grew in numbers
            during the Wilhelmine period.</a
          >
          German feminists began to network with feminists from other countries,
          and participated in the growth of international organizations. Their
          goal was to achieve greater economic and political equality for women
          while integrating women's concerns into broader socialist agenda.
          <br /><br />
          In contrast to its German counterpart, women's rights activism in the
          US began earlier, during the
          <a
            href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/abolitionist-movement"
            >abolitionist movements</a
          >
          of the mid-19th century.
          <a
            href="https://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/the-fight-for-womens-suffrage"
            >Suffrage</a
          >
          was an integral component of women's rights activism here and women
          fought long and hard for this right to vote. Women in the US
          participated in labor movements like unions but their individual
          rights movements did not overlap as closely with socialism as did
          their movements elsewhere in Europe. <br /><br />
          Overall, historical circumstances shaped the goals and tactics of
          women's rights movements in both Germany and the US differently;
          Germany saw its women's movement align more closely with socialist and
          labor movements while its US counterpart focused more on individual
          liberation and personal rights.
