          <h3> Exhibit Description</h3>
          Suffrage was a significant area of difference between the women's rights movement in Germany and the United States.
        </br></br>
          In Germany, women gained the right to vote in 1918, as a result of the political upheaval following World War I. The end of the war led to the collapse of the German monarchy, and the establishment of a democratic government. Women's participation in the war effort, as well as their role in the labor movement, helped to secure the right to vote for women. However, the right to vote was not extended to all women in Germany until after World War II, when the country was divided into two parts. In East Germany, women gained full voting rights in 1949, while in West Germany, women did not gain the right to vote until 1953.
        </br></br>
          In the United States, the women's suffrage movement began in the mid-19th century and culminated with the passage of the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution in 1920. The suffrage movement in the US was a long and hard-fought battle, involving protests, lobbying, and civil disobedience. Women in the US faced significant opposition from conservative groups and lawmakers who argued that giving women the right to vote would undermine the traditional family structure and lead to social disorder. The suffrage movement in the US was also closely tied to the broader women's rights movement, which sought to address issues such as workplace discrimination, reproductive rights, and gender-based violence.
        </br></br>
          Overall, while women in both Germany and the United States eventually gained the right to vote, the paths to suffrage were different, reflecting the unique political and social contexts in each country. In Germany, women's right to vote was tied to the country's political and social upheavals, while in the US, suffrage was the culmination of a long and hard-fought battle by women's rights activists.
