                  More than 1,000 demonstrators gather May 14, 2022, to protest
                  in response to the draft Supreme Court decision that could
                  overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The protest took place
                  at Legislative Plaza in Nashville. Across the country protests
                  have taken place in response to the potential overturning of
                  the nearly 50-year-old precedent.

          <h3>Reproductive Rights: Germany and the US</h3>
          <br />
          <h2>Exhibit Description</h2>
          Germany and the United States had distinct approaches to sexuality and
          reproductive rights within their women's rights movements.
          <br /><br />
          Germany is notable for its

            >progressive approach to sexuality and reproductive rights;</a
          >
          feminists championed legalized abortion and access to birth control as
          key elements in women's overall liberation, challenging traditional
          gender roles and seeking sexual liberation free from patriarchal
          constraints. Furthermore, these feminists saw reproductive rights and
          sexual liberation as integral to ensuring their bodily autonomy.
          <br /><br />

          In the United States, feminist movements also advocated for
          reproductive rights but faced strong resistance from conservative
          groups and lawmakers. Reproductive rights were cemented with

          which legalized abortion nationwide but is contested today with
          ongoing efforts by some states to restrict access. To that end,

            >Roe v. Wade was reversed by the Supreme Court in June 2022</a
          >, ending the consitutional right to abortion upheld for decades.
          Feminists also challenged traditional gender roles and advocated
          sexual liberation within American culture, yet were subject to more
          conservative social and political climate than German counterparts.
          <br /><br />

          Overall, both movements understood the significance of reproductive
          rights and sexual freedom but faced different levels of opposition and
          challenges in their respective countries. Germany saw more progressive
          attitudes towards sexuality and reproductive rights while America
          faced more conservative social and political climates for women's
          movements.
