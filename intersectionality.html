                          <h5>Helke Sander was allowed to speak - after being heard with a tomato.</h5>
                          <p>During a speech at the 23rd delegates' conference of the Socialist German Student Union (SDS) on September 13, 1968, Helke Sander presented the concept of the Action Council and denounced the discrimination against women in the SDS. But the panel, which was made up exclusively of men, wanted to move on to other topics without discussing the lecture. The heavily pregnant Romance studies student Sigrid RÃ¼ger angrily threw tomatoes onto the podium.
                          </br></br>
                            This tomato throw - and its reception in the media - brought the problem of women into the public eye. As a result, the first women's councils and other women's groups were founded.</p>

          <h3> Exhibit Description</h3>
          Intersectionality is a concept that recognizes the interconnectedness of social identities such as race, gender, sexuality, class, and ability, and how they create unique experiences of oppression and privilege. While feminism seeks gender equality, intersectional feminism also acknowledges the impact of these other identities and their intersections on women's experiences.
          </br></br>
In terms of intersectionality, Germany and the United States have different histories and cultural contexts that shape their intersectional feminist movements. In Germany, feminism emerged from the country's divided history, as the women's movement grew out of opposition to both the authoritarian East German state and the patriarchal culture of the West. Intersectional feminism in Germany has been more focused on issues of social justice and solidarity with other marginalized groups such as refugees and LGBTQ+ individuals.
</br></br>
In the United States, intersectional feminism has been shaped by its history of racial inequality, with women of color playing a prominent role in the development of intersectional feminist theory. Intersectional feminism in the US has been more focused on addressing systemic racism and the ways in which race and gender intersect to create unique experiences of oppression for women of color.
</br></br>
In terms of policy and legislation, Germany has made significant progress in intersectionality and gender equality, with policies such as parental leave and affordable childcare that support women's participation in the workforce. The country also has a higher representation of women in politics, with women holding over 30% of seats in the Bundestag, the German federal parliament. However, despite these advancements, there are still issues with pay inequality and gender-based violence that need to be addressed, particularly for women who belong to other marginalized groups such as LGBTQ+ individuals or refugees.
</br></br>
In the US, intersectional feminism has been instrumental in pushing for policies and legislation that address the intersectional experiences of women of color and other marginalized groups. However, progress has been slow and there are still significant disparities in pay, healthcare, and access to reproductive services that disproportionately affect women who belong to marginalized groups. Additionally, the US has a relatively low representation of women in politics, with women holding only 27% of seats in the US Congress.
</br></br>
In conclusion, intersectionality plays a crucial role in shaping feminist movements and advocating for gender equality. While Germany and the US have made progress in intersectional feminism, there are still significant challenges and disparities that need to be addressed, particularly for women who belong to other marginalized groups. It is important for feminist movements to continue to center intersectionality and work towards greater equality and justice for all.
