                  was Dorothea Erxleben in 1754. She was taught practical
                  medicine by her father, then the Prussian king ordered the
                  University of Halle to register her for the PhD programme. In
                  January 1754 she handed in her dissertation, called 'Academic

                  nonetheless frequently uncertain' (''Academische Abhandlung

                  The Equal Pay Act had been drafted by Esther Peterson, head of
                  the Women’s Bureau of the Department of Labor. It prohibited
                  employers who were subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of
                  1938 (under which the new law fell) from paying employees
                  differently, on the basis of gender, for work that required
                  “equal skill, effort, and responsibility.”

          <h3>Cultural Norms: Germany and the US</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Exhibit Description</h4>
          Cultural attitudes and norms regarding gender roles and expectations
          have an enormous effect on women in different countries, such as
          Germany and the US. Their cultural norms surrounding these
          expectations differ considerably and have had an great influence on
          each country's women's rights movements.
          <br /><br />
          German women have historically had
          <a
            href="https://ehne.fr/en/encyclopedia/themes/gender-and-europe/educating-europeans/gender-and-vocational-education-in-europe-19th-20th-centuries"
            >greater access to education</a
          >
          and employment opportunities earlier than women in the United States.
          Beginning in the early 20th century, Germany established a system of
          <a
            href="https://www.germany.info/us-en/welcome/wirtschaft/03-Wirtschaft/-/1048296"
            >vocational education designed specifically to train women for jobs </a
          >traditionally filled by men such as engineering and science.
          Furthermore, after World War II Germany's government provided support
          for women's education as part of efforts to rebuild the nation;
          leading to
          <a
            href="https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2013/retrieve.php?pdfid=152"
            >greater participation of women in workforce</a
          >
          as well as women's rights activism during this period - leading up to
          women's rights activism being established throughout the 70s and 80s
          eras. <br /><br />

          German women did experience considerable advances, yet still faced
          great pressure to conform to traditional gender roles. German society
          placed great emphasis on family values, with women often expected to
          prioritize family roles over careers - the
          <a
            href="https://germanculture.com.ua/germany-facts/women-in-german-society/"
            >traditional view being that women provided primary caregivers while
            men served as breadwinners</a
          >; though women's movements challenged these views and advocated for
          greater gender equality - traditional gender roles remained deeply
          embedded within German society despite efforts made by various
          feminist movements and the women's movement to advance equality
          between genders. <br /><br />

          Women faced many barriers to education and employment opportunities
          prior to the 1960s in the US. As a response, the
          <a
            href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/civil-rights-history-project/articles-and-essays/women-in-the-civil-rights-movement/"
            >American women's rights movement</a
          >
          developed in response to these inequalities and advocated for greater
          access to education, employment opportunities, political power,
          reproductive rights and an end of gender discrimination at work.
          Feminism in particular challenged traditional gender roles while
          advocating for greater gender equality -
          <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/equal-pay-act-1963"
            >equal pay for equal work</a
          >
          as well as reproductive rights were important goals of this movement
          in particular. <br /><br />

          While cultural attitudes and expectations regarding gender roles and
          expectations were very different in Germany and the United States,
          both countries experienced substantial changes as a result of the
          women's rights movement. These changes included greater access to
          education and employment opportunities for women as well as
          challenging traditional gender expectations; yet traditional roles
          still persist and efforts for gender equality continue in both
          nations.
